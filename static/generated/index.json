    "prompt": "Documentary editorial photograph of a diverse group of startup founders collaborating in a modern office space, captured in natural window light with a slightly warm color temperature. The scene shows 2-3 professionals in thoughtful conversation or decision-making, seated or standing around a table with minimal analog tools like notebooks and coffee, surrounded by natural materials such as wood, plants, and soft furnishings. The composition uses medium proximity and shallow depth of field, placing the people off-center with architectural negative space and softly blurred background details. Expressions are engaged, calm, and authentic, with subtle gestures and open body language. The environment feels lived-in and premium but approachable, with no visible screens, text, or corporate clutter. Editorial realism, with a focus on human capability and genuine collaboration, suitable for a magazine spread.",
