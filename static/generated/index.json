    "prompt": "Documentary editorial photograph of a diverse group of startup founders collaborating in a modern office space, captured in natural window light with a slightly warm color temperature. The scene shows 2-3 professionals in thoughtful conversation or decision-making, seated or standing around a table with minimal analog tools like notebooks and coffee, surrounded by natural materials such as wood, plants, and soft furnishings.
